Filtering ad-tech data with R

This R script allows for the importation of a CSV file containing ad-tech. The code then extracts specific columns from the data, formats the dates in the data, create a new data frame from the extracted columns, and filter the data by month and year.

This code can be used to analyze the acquisition date and active machine of some ad-tech data.
The code can also be used to compare the ad-tech data across different time periods.

To use the script: 
Paste in the file path of your data and run the script
